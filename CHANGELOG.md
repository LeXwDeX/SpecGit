# specgit

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- **`specgit issue <title-or-number>...`** — one-command bootstrap: creates or reuses N issues (one issue = one independently verifiable WHY), branches, opens the draft pull request that closes every bound issue, writes `.specgit.yaml`, and pushes. Re-running resumes; it is idempotent.
- **`specgit finish`** — the evidence verdict (pure delegation to the acceptance evaluator; `accept` remains as a machine alias). Exit 0 is the only "done".
- **`specgit pr`** — repairs the pull-request binding: auto-discovers the PR by head branch, errors with a fix when none is found, refuses with a list when several match.
- **`specgit init` generates the harness**: `.github/workflows/specgit-accept.yml` (job *SpecGit Acceptance* runs the verdict on every PR, waits for sibling required checks by name, stays out of `policy.required_checks` to avoid self-deadlock) plus a managed prompt block injected between exact markers in AGENTS.md (created when missing) and CLAUDE.md (only when present). Re-init overwrites the block only.
- **Agent surface simplified**: `skills/` and `.opencode/command/` removed — the AGENTS.md block plus `docs/agent-contract.md` are the behavior source. `bind`/`unbind`/`accept` remain as machine aliases.
- Dogfooded: the acceptance gate ran on its own delivery PR and caught four real harness defects before release.

## 0.0.1

### Initial release

SpecGit is a delivery binding and acceptance harness. This is the first
release of a new product; it replaces OpenSpec with no compatibility or
migration path.

- **Product identity.** Package `specgit`, CLI `specgit`, project data root
  `spec_git/`, delivery record `.specgit.yaml`. Canonical repository:
  https://github.com/LeXwDeX/SpecGit.
- **Delivery model.** A change binds one git branch or one git worktree to
  `issues[]` and one pull request; one PR may bind and close N issues.
- **Evidence-derived acceptance.** `specgit accept` derives its verdict
  fail-closed from real git, PR, and check evidence through mockable provider
  adapters (`git` locally, `gh` as the GitHub seam; `SPECGIT_GH` overrides the
  gh command). Spec artifacts, task files, or any other file contents can
  never change acceptance. Exit contract: 0 accepted · 1 rejected · 2 usage ·
  3 fail-closed unknown.
- **Command surface.** `specgit init` (write `spec_git/policy.yaml`), `bind`,
  `unbind`, `status`, `accept`, `doctor`. Non-interactive; exactly one JSON
  document on stdout with `--json`.
- **Agent surface.** Skills (`specgit-setup-policy`, `specgit-bind-delivery`,
  `specgit-accept-delivery`), the agent contract (`docs/agent-contract.md`),
  and the workflow guide (`docs/workflow-guide.md`).
