### Automated npm releases

Merging a PR to `main` with pending changesets now publishes automatically: the Release workflow consumes the changesets, bumps the version, builds, publishes to npm (automation token in the `NPM` environment), pushes the `v<version>` tag, and creates the GitHub Release. Direct pushes to `main` remain blocked by the pre-push guard, so every release traces to a merged PR. The beta-dispatch and GitHub-App/OIDC machinery from the inherited workflow is removed.
